<H1 align="center">AlterLens(Media Processing App)</H1>

In this repository I will be successfully creating an app named AlterLens using PyQt in which an image or a video will be uploaded and then out of four image processing techniques, one will be applied.

- First of all you have to install all the libraries required to run the app.
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
- Then users will upload either a picture or a video file.
  1. If an image is uploaded, it should be displayed on the screen.
  2. If a video is uploaded, the screen should display the first frame of the video. Users should be able to navigate through subsequent frames using the provided buttons.
- Then you should have the option to apply various image processing techniques to the uploaded media. These techniques include:
  • Thresholding
  • Histogram Equalization
  • Averaging Filter
  • Adaptive Thresholding
  • Clustering (with optimal number of clusters)
  • LoG
  • Erosion
  • Dilation
  • Closing
  • Opening
- Upon selecting a technique, the program should process the media accordingly and display the result on the output panel.


  # Happy Coding :)
